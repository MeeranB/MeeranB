### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack developer with experience mainly in Angular / Laravel.

Below are some of the things I have worked on, namely:

### Laravel mail

A mailing system I created as part of a commercial development cycle, the business logic was recreated in Laravel / Blade with reference to a deprecated Symfony / Twig codebase.

### Netmatters Facsimile

A replicated version of the Netmatters homepage and contact pages with a basic back-end for storing contact form data, created with vanilla PHP and SCSS.

### companyManager

A Laravel app with CRUD functionality, pagination and basic authentication.
